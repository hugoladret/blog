Hi, and thanks for stopping by my corner of the Internet. This post is completely redundant with the [about page](https://hugoladret.github.io/about/), which already states the general idea behind the website.

Let's have one first empty blogpost nonetheless, so as to have a first timemark to refer to in the distant future.

See you around !
