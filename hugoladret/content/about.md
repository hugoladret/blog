Thank you for visiting this corner of the Internet ! 

## The website
Goal here is to efficiently share serious thoughts, in informal tone. Writing in this concise style helps :-)

Also an ideal format to share short tutorials on things that perplexed me. 

Also useful to dump random assortment of thoughts. 

Most importantly, convenient platform to host open-access PDFs.

## The author
Hugo here. Postdoctoral researcher, focused on [predictive coding](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2005.1622?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) - a promising brain theory that might explain decades of seemingly disparate results in neuroscience.

Neurobiologist by training, but advocate for strong theory-driven approach to experiments.
Did experimental work in vision during PhD, now doing experimental work on psychiatric conditions and treatments.
Theoretical interests encompass all things neural network-related. Details on my [résumé](https://hugoladret.github.io/resume/resume.pdf).

Also play the piano for a hobby - picked up weightlifting recently.
