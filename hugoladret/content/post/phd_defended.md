# Big news
Finished not 1, but 2 PhDs ! (technically 2 times 1, let's settle for 1.5)\ 
Went through 4.5 years of "cotutelle" journey, resulted in doctorate from both Université de Montréal and Aix-Marseille University.  
Fun experience, except for nightmarish administrative BS.

Overall, challenging, fulfilling experience. Tackled simple problem: implementation of probabilistic computations in the brain. Two simultaneous angles of attack for this.

With [Christian Casanova](https://opto.umontreal.ca/recherche/unites/laboratoire-neurosciences-vision/), conducted brain recordings in various setups. Goal: understand how neurons encode environmental uncertainty.
With [Laurent Perrinet](https://laurentperrinet.github.io/), developed computer models of these neurons. Explained existence, necessity of these neurons.

Things I did, non-exhaustive list:
* Showed new type of response to uncertainty in cortex: https://hugoladret.github.io/publications/ladret_et_al_variance_v1/
* Developed deep learning models: https://hugoladret.github.io/publications/ladret_et_al_sparsecoding/
* Framed this under Bayesian principles: https://hugoladret.github.io/publications/cortes_et_al_review/
* Created large scale models, linked to neurobiology: https://hugoladret.github.io/publications/cortes_et_al_pulvinar/
Tremendous fun ! Equally about science and personal journey.

In 4.5 years, progressed from failing basic high school maths to writing hundreds of pages filled with equations for [manuscript](https://github.com/hugoladret/PhD_manuscript).\
From stage fright in lab classes to performing neurosurgical procedures solo. Learned comfort in discomfort - valuable lesson.

Onward to new adventures in April!


# Fun fact

^ Holding microphone to the president of the jury [Elvire Vaucher](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=shhSLlAAAAAJ&hl=fr) during official investiture.  
Very hard not to laugh - this is the moment brain chose to remember many "is there a doctor here" "im a doctor in computational neuroscience" memes.
