Thanks for stopping by my corner of the Internet.

## Who am I ?
I'm Hugo, a PhD student researching [predictive coding](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2005.1622?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), an influential brain theory that promises to account for the many seemingly disparate results neuroscientists have gathered over decades of experiments.

I'm a neurobiologist by training, but I believe no good science can be done without a theory-driven approach. My experimental work is mostly about vision, while my theoreotical interests are about anything neural network-related. You can read the fine details on my [résumé](https://hugoladret.github.io/resume/resume.pdf).

I also play piano for a hobby, and, like the stereotypical Frenchman I am, can find you a decent bottle of wine at any conference.

## What's all this about ?
This website is a way to share actually serious thoughts in an informal delivery style, much like in the section above. I feel this is necessary, as most people only get to see the tip of the iceberg of a scientist's train of thoughts through articles that have been transmuted by editing and peer reviewing.

Therefore, this website constitutes the non-tip of the iceberg (formally dubbed the [bummock](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/ice-forecasts-observations/latest-conditions/glossary.html#wsglossaryB)) of my brain.

Additionally, this website serves as a convenient platform to host open-access PDFs of my research, and as a linking hub for diverse social medias links.
